**Example:**
```json
{
  "to": "example@example.com",
  "subject": "Execution ID: {{executionId}} results",
  "text": "Link to html results: https://api.apify.com/v1/execs/{{executionId}}/results?format=html&simplified=1",
  "html":  "Link to html <a href=\"https://api.apify.com/v1/execs/{{executionId}}/results?format=html&simplified=1\"> results </a>",
  "attachResults": [
    {
        "format": "csv",
        "simplified": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

- `html`(String) - Email html body

- `attachResults`(Array) - Array of types of results that will be attach to email. Attribute `format` is required for each type ([all types of format](https://www.apify.com/docs/api-v1#/reference/results)). Use same attributes as [Get Execution results api endpoint](https://www.apify.com/docs/api-v1#/reference/results/last-execution-results/get-last-execution-results), `simplified`, `offset`, `limit` etc.
